### 10.2 Confidentiality

remain confidential. All open session Boardroom discussions shall remain confidential until the minutes of those
discussions are approved for dissemination by a majority of the Board except and unless otherwise approved by a
three-quarters (3/4) majority of the Board. Executive session discussions shall be confidential. No Officer or
Director shall supply copies or disseminate such confidential information to any third party without the written
consent or by resolution of the Board of Directors, except as otherwise provided in these Bylaws.

This prohibition shall not apply to disclosure of such confidential information to the professional advisers of the
Officers or Directors, as the case may be, although such professional advisers shall then keep it confidential. This
prohibition shall not apply to disclosure to any governmental agencies to which information shall be required for
the operation of the Corporation.

Members serving as affiliated club contact, corporate officers, employees, Section Coordinators and Area Directors
may have their names phone numbers, E-mail address, City and States published at various times and places.

### 10.3 Fiduciary Duty
The Fiduciary Duty requires a Director (including officers) to act for the organizations benefit, while subordinating
his or her personal interest. Directors must act prudently, loyally, and in good faith to maximize USPSA's value
over the long-term for the benefit of its members.

i.) Duty of Care – A Director must perform the duties of a Director, including duties as a member of any
committee of the Board upon which the Director may serve, in good faith, in a manner such Director
believes to be in the best interest of the organization, and with such care, including reasonable inquiry,
as an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. In performing
the duties of a Director, a Director shall be entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports, or
statements, including financial statements and other financial data, in each case prepared or presented
by:

a. one or more officers or employees of the organization who the Director reasonably believes to be
reliable and competent in the matter presented;

b. legal counsel, public accountants, organizational staff, or other persons as to matters which the
Director reasonably believes to be within such person's professional or expert competence and who
has been selected with reasonable care by or on behalf of the Corporation; or

c. a committee of the Board upon which the Director does not serve, duly designated as to matters
within its designated authority, which committee the Director believes to merit confidence; so long
as, in any such case, the Director acts in good faith, after reasonable inquiry when the need is
indicated by the circumstances, and without knowledge that would cause such reliance to be
unwarranted.

ii.) Duty of Loyalty – Directors must exercise their powers and duties in good faith, free of conflict, and
within a view to the interest of the organization and consistent with the purposes of the organization.
Duty of loyalty means publicly disclosing any conflicts of interest and not using board service as a
means to personal or commercial gain.

iii.) Duty of Obedience – Directors must make sure that the organization is abiding by all applicable laws
and regulations and doesn't engage in illegal or unauthorized activities. The duty of obedience also
means that board directors must carry out the organization's mission in accordance with the purpose stated in the organization's governing documents.

### 10.4 Conflict of Interest
A Conflict of Interest (COI) occurs where an individual's obligation to further the organization's purposes is at odds with their own financial interest. Conflicts of Interest may exist for reasons other than a financial interest (e.g.,
a relationship or something which might affect a person's ability to act impartially in the best interests of the
Corporation on a specific topic). A COI is not necessarily prohibited, as long as it is disclosed and appropriately
managed. USPSA has adopted "Conflict of Interest Policy", recommended by the IRS, in order to ensure that the
organization's definitions and practices in this area are and remain in conformance with IRS guidelines for tax-exempt organizations. A copy of the current policy will be maintained as part of USPSA's standing policies, and
shall serve as USPSA's standing policy for defining, disclosing, reviewing, reporting and managing any relationship
deemed to be a Conflict of Interest. Each USPSA director and officer shall receive a copy of the USPSA Conflict
of Interest policy and file an Annual Statement, using the form included in the Policy Manual, prior to the first
regular meeting of each calendar year, and shall revise that statement any time a circumstance changes which could
affect the validity of their statement. The USPSA Board shall conduct a Periodic Review of these Annual Statements
at the 1st in-person regular Board meeting of each year. The corporation shall review the USPSA COI policy
language at the beginning of each calendar year in order to ensure that the USPSA policy accurately reflects the
current language in the IRS sample policy. In the event that there is a conflict between USPSA's documented COI
policy and the current language of the IRS sample policy, the current IRS language shall prevail, subject only to
applicable state and federal laws governing conflict of interest applicable to nonprofit and charitable organizations.

### 10.5 Gender
When required by the context, the masculine or feminine designations throughout these bylaws will include any
recognized gender and the neuter, and vice versa.

### 10.6 Employee Supervision
No elected individual may be the sole supervisor of a USPSA employee.

## ARTICLE 11 - AREA DIVISIONS

There shall be established within the United States certain geographical designations known as Areas. Each Area

for improvements in the Area, including such things as RO seminars, range improvements, sponsorships to junior

be documented in the final accounting of the match and submitted to headquarters.

### 11.3 Accountability

The President may charter a Section either upon application of the clubs within a defined geographical area or he
may split an existing Section upon the recommendation of the Area Director. The Area Director shall appoint a
Section Coordinator to administer a Section until the clubs hold an election therein.

No Section shall be chartered that crosses Area boundaries except under circumstances of severe hardship involving
lack of proximity to a Section within the clubs area. Sections wishing to qualify for this exception must petition
the President and the affected Area Directors and provide evidence of such hardship. No Section shall be chartered
unless the Area Director and President are first provided prospective Section bylaws for approval.

The Section bylaws shall be subordinate to these bylaws, all rules of competition as approved by the Board of
Directors and shall set forth a means for distribution of national championship slots. The distribution shall always
consider placement in practical shooting events and may additionally consider club membership and assistance at
the events. Slots may never be awarded by lot. All Sections will be required to provide bylaws to the Area Director
and the national office following any amendment and at the time of each Section Coordinator election. In the
absence of Section bylaws being provided to the national office on an annual basis, Sections shall be held to the
guidelines of a standard set of requirements as approved by the Board of Directors and maintained at the national
office.

### 12.2 Section Coordinators
The Section Coordinator shall be elected by the member clubs within the assigned Section, on the basis of one vote
per member, or member club, as determined by the Section bylaws.

The Section Coordinator's term of office shall be determined by the Section bylaws, and Sections must hold an
election at least every two years. It is the responsibility of the Section Coordinator and the member clubs to organize
and conduct an election each regular two-year election cycle for their respective Section.

The Section Coordinator shall serve until he or she resigns, relinquishes the office, or an election is held.

The Area Director may remove a Section Coordinator for cause. The Area Director's decision may be appealed to
the Board of Directors by the individual Section Coordinator or by any club within the Section. The Board shall
review the appeal and make a final determination at its next Regular Meeting.

Should a Section Coordinator's office become vacant, the Area Director has the authority to appoint a Section
Coordinator until such time as an election for that Section is held. A section shall hold elections as specified by
their bylaws, or any time a majority of the club presidents in that Section call for a special election for Section
Coordinator.

The Section Coordinator must maintain at least annual membership to hold office and must hold a Range Officer
(Level I) or higher NROI certification.

### 12.3 Duties of Section Coordinator

traditions and standards of USPSA. The Section Coordinator supports the development of new shooters and new
clubs by providing information, support, and guidance.

i.) actively promote the Corporation and its policies, rules, ideals and concepts,

match,

Sections may levy activity fees, not to exceed one US Dollar, on each contestant in a corporation approved contest,
provided the Section has adopted bylaws that have been approved by the Corporation and insure representation and
accountability to local clubs in the Section. Such fees are to cover the cost of the Section Coordinator's office and
such other reasonable projects beneficial to all Section clubs, are to be utilized solely for the actual expenses thereof,
and a full accounting shall be rendered annually to the clubs of that Section. Such fees, if levied, are in addition to
and unrelated to any established activity fees due the Corporation.

### 12.5 Independent Clubs
A club may form as an Independent Club due to geographical location or for specific business related reasons.
Clubs belonging to a Section may petition the Section Coordinator and Area Director to become an Independent
club or to join a different Section due to geographical or specific business related reasons. The Area Director,
following consultation with the President, may grant permission after determining that all financial obligations to
the Section have been met. All activity credits earned prior to the approval shall remain the property of the club.
The Area Director's decision may be appealed to the Board of Directors by the petitioning club or by any club
within the Section. The Board shall review the appeal and make a final determination at its next Regular Meeting.

### 14.1 Waiver of Notice
Any required notice may be waived by the written consent of the person entitled to such notice either before or after
